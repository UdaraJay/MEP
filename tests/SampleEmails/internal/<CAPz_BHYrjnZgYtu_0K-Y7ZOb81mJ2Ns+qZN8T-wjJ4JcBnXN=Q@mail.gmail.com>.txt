Hey Lexa,

Happy to site down with you sometime and guide you through. First off
though I was wondering if you're doing all this with WordPress? Because all
the problems you're describing; WordPress can solve?

I usually freelance at a much higher rate, but I can do $25/hr if that
works for you?

Let me know!
